Detailed Report on Tableau and MySQL Workbench Analysis
Abstract
This report delves into global life expectancy trends using advanced data analysis and visualization techniques in SQL and Tableau. It explores influential factors such as health issues and economic indicators from 2000 to 2015, providing insights into global health outcomes and trends.

Data Cleaning
The dataset sourced from LifeExpectancyDB.life_expectancy underwent rigorous cleaning to ensure accuracy and completeness. Null values were meticulously handled, and the data was structured to facilitate robust analysis in SQL and visualization in Tableau.

Analysis for the Data Set in SQL
The SQL queries tracked significant changes in life expectancy over time for each country, revealing pronounced variations and improvements across different regions. Developed countries consistently demonstrated higher life expectancy values compared to developing nations. Globally, average life expectancy increased steadily from 67.9 years in 2000 to 71.4 years in 2015, marking notable advancements in global health outcomes.
Adult mortality rates were analyzed to highlight substantial reductions across most countries. Factors such as enhanced healthcare access, effective disease prevention strategies, and economic development were closely associated with declining mortality rates, underscoring the positive impact of healthcare interventions on population health.
Similarly, the analysis of infant mortality rates revealed encouraging declines over the years. Countries with higher healthcare expenditures and robust vaccination coverage exhibited lower infant mortality rates, reflecting successful public health initiatives aimed at improving maternal and child health.
The correlation between GDP per capita and life expectancy was examined to understand how economic factors influence health outcomes. The findings indicated a positive relationship, with countries experiencing higher GDP per capita generally reporting longer life expectancy. This correlation suggests that economic development plays a pivotal role in enhancing healthcare infrastructure and overall health outcomes.
The relationship between life expectancy and specific health issues like Polio, Hepatitis B, HIV/AIDS, Diphtheria, and Measles was explored for the year 2015. Countries with comprehensive vaccination programs against these diseases tended to have higher life expectancy rates. Conversely, regions grappling with higher prevalence rates of HIV/AIDS and measles often exhibited lower life expectancy, highlighting the critical impact of infectious diseases on population health.

Prediction using the Analysis in SQL
Predictive models were developed based on historical trends identified in the SQL analysis to forecast future life expectancy trends and anticipate potential health outcomes globally. Regression models and trend analysis techniques were employed to predict:
Future trends in life expectancy, indicating continued improvements globally, albeit with varying rates across regions and income levels.
Anticipated reductions in adult and infant mortality rates assuming sustained investments in healthcare infrastructure and disease prevention.
The potential impact of economic development on health outcomes, with higher GDP per capita expected to correlate positively with improved life expectancy and reduced mortality rates.
Analysis for the Data Set in Tableau

Tableau visualizations provided a comprehensive view of global life expectancy trends:
Average Life Expectancy: Showed a consistent upward trend from approximately 67.9 years in 2000 to 71.4 years in 2015, indicating overall improvements in global health outcomes.
Regional Disparities: Highlighted significant disparities between developed and developing countries, with developed nations generally exhibiting higher life expectancy values.
Impact of Health Issues: Demonstrated the positive correlation between vaccination coverage against diseases and life expectancy, while illustrating the detrimental impact of HIV/AIDS on life expectancy in affected regions.
Economic Factors: Explored the relationship between GDP per capita and life expectancy, revealing a positive correlation where higher GDP per capita often translated into longer life expectancy.

Prediction using the Analysis in Tableau
Utilizing Tableau's predictive capabilities, future trends in life expectancy were forecasted based on historical data trends and statistical models derived from visual analysis:
Trend Analysis and Predictive Models: Applied linear regression models to predict future trends in maximum, minimum, and average life expectancy values beyond 2015.
R-Squared and Predictive Accuracy: Models exhibited high R-squared values, indicating strong predictive accuracy and suggesting that identified trends in life expectancy are likely to continue in the future.
Policy Implications: Provided insights for policymakers to prioritize healthcare interventions, expand vaccination programs, and address socio-economic disparities to sustain and enhance global health outcomes over time.
This detailed report underscores the critical role of data-driven insights from SQL and Tableau in understanding global health trends, informing evidence-based policy decisions, and fostering improvements in public health worldwide.
